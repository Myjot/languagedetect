The language classification example shows just how easily the FANN library can be applied to solve simple, everyday computer science problems which would be much more difficult to solve using other methods. Unfortunately, not all problems can be solved this easily, and when working with ANNs, one often finds oneself in a situation in which it is very difficult to train the ANN to give the correct results. Sometimes, this is because the problem simply cannot be solved by ANNs, but often, the training can be helped by tweaking the FANN library settings.
